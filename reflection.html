                This course was one of the most fun classes i have ever taken and i loved every second of it while also learning a lot about coding Mr Murry was one of my favorite teachers I have ever had and the Surroundings of that class were amazing just the whole vibe of the room was great I loved the people i got to meet there around the year. Even if I had a bad day it would always get better. 
            </p>
            <p>One of the things we learned this year was the basics of coding and the usefulness of it. For example we learnt a little bit of Java script, Karel a bit of python we also used a bunch of vs code in vs code there was a bunch of replacements for basic keys like copy and paste. Paste is ctrl shift v and super complicated and hard to remember.
            </p>
            <p>in our midterm exam i had little to no clue what i was doing because i had payed little to no attention to anything we leant in that class but i still pulled thruogh and got a good grade on it we had to wright a code to cauculate the temputre and mean this was super easy because its just simple math  </p>
            <p>And that brings us to our final we had to create a website and put things on it like these paragraps most of second semester was us doing code hs and working in ubuntu adn when we werent doing that we were trying to break the system overall it was fun and I had to actully think about things in this class i had to put in high effort and got good results in turn thank you for being such a good teacher Mr Murry and i hope to see you again eventualy have a good summer </p>
